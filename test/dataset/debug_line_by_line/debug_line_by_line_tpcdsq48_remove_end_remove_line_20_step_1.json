Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Among these, only `date_dim` exists in the provided schema. There are no references to `store_sales`, `store`, `customer_demographics`, or `customer_address` in the schema information. Additionally, while `d_year` from `date_dim` is correctly referenced, other columns such as `ss_quantity`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_sales_price`, `ss_addr_sk`, `ca_address_sk`, `ca_country`, `ca_state` and others do not exist in the schema.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The errors in the SQL query stem from referencing non-existent tables and columns. The query attempts to use several columns from tables that are not defined in the schema section provided, such as `ss_quantity`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, etc., leading to the syntax error noted at the end of input. The query lacks proper closure and potentially expects more information or conditions that are not present due to these missing tables and columns. \n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.
