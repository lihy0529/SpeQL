Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

You only explain what is wrong based on the schema and the query itself.\nIdentify whether all referenced tables and columns exist in the schema.\nExplain the error clearly and briefly, without altering the query's semantics or adding new logic.\nIdentify exactly where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located and confirm that it must remain in the same position in the corrected query.\nKeep the case sensitivity, formatting, and spacing as in the original query.\nIf the dialect is Redshift and date arithmetic is involved, remember to use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\nYour answer should have three paragraphs, starting with: \"My explanation has the following three parts:\"\n\nFirst paragraph (start with \"Check schema:\"):\n\nState if each table/column is correct or if there are invalid references. Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query. Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

Furthermore, the query syntax structure does involve subqueries which intersect or compare results from multiple sales sources, but these columns need proper existence and usage tied to a valid GROUP BY or aggregate function.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located at the end of the SQL query, after the second subquery block following the placeholder for the logic related to finding the date sequence (`d_week_seq`).

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query. Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

The tables `item` and `date_dim` are correctly referenced based on the schema provided. However, there is a reference to other tables such as `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` whose schemas were not provided, making it impossible to verify the correctness of columns such as `ss_item_sk`, `cs_item_sk`, `ws_item_sk`, etc.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The main issue in the query appears to be related to the use of certain columns in the SELECT clause that must also appear in the GROUP BY clause, as indicated by the error message regarding the \"column 'item.i_brand_id'\". Additionally, the error regarding a \"syntax error at end of input\" suggests that the second subquery in the outer SELECT statement is incomplete. It seems to end abruptly, which would cause a syntax error due to the missing closing parentheses and possibly other syntactical components needed to complete the query.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is placed after the subquery in the FROM clause of the second SELECT statement that follows the UNION.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

You only explain what is wrong based on the schema and the query itself.\nIdentify whether all referenced tables and columns exist in the schema.\nExplain the error clearly and briefly, without altering the query's semantics or adding new logic.\nIdentify exactly where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located and confirm that it must remain in the same position in the corrected query.\nKeep the case sensitivity, formatting, and spacing as in the original query.\nIf the dialect is Redshift and date arithmetic is involved, remember to use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\nYour answer should have three paragraphs, starting with: \"My explanation has the following three parts:\"\n\nFirst paragraph (start with \"Check schema:\"):\n\nState if each table/column is correct or if there are invalid references. Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query. Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

According to the provided schema information, only the 'item' and 'date_dim' tables are described. I'm not provided with the column details for 'store_sales', 'catalog_sales', and 'web_sales',; thus, any specific validation of column names in these tables cannot be performed. For the 'item' table, columns like 'i_item_sk', 'i_brand_id', 'i_class_id', and 'i_category_id' are valid. The 'date_dim' table includes columns such as 'd_date_sk', 'd_year', 'd_moy', 'd_dom', and 'd_week_seq', which are also correctly referenced in the query.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics or adding logic): The errors lie in the incomplete parentheses for the subquery under the alias 'last_year'. The columns 'i_brand_id', 'i_class_id', and 'i_category_id' are followed by the \"GROUP BY\" clause without completing the previous subquery with a closing parenthesis. The result is a syntax error indicating an incomplete statement before reaching the GROUP BY clause.\n\nIdentify"

However, the issue arises from the use of `i_brand_id`, `i_class_id`, and `i_category_id` in the main SELECT query. While these columns are present in the `item` table, they are not included in the `GROUP BY` clause of the outer queries where they are used. Hence, their use without aggregation leads to the error.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The nature of the error lies in the SQL standard that requires any column in the SELECT list that is not part of an aggregate function (like SUM or COUNT) to be included in the GROUP BY clause. In this case, `item.i_brand_id`, `item.i_class_id`, and `item.i_category_id` are being selected without being aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause, hence the SQL error indicating that these columns must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function as specified by the error message.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the second SELECT statement within the main grouping query, right",

However, the issue arises from the use of `i_brand_id`, `i_class_id`, and `i_category_id` in the main SELECT query. While these columns are present in the `item` table, they are not included in the `GROUP BY` clause of the outer queries where they are used. Hence, their use without aggregation leads to the error.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The nature of the error lies in the SQL standard that requires any column in the SELECT list that is not part of an aggregate function (like SUM or COUNT) to be included in the GROUP BY clause. In this case, `item.i_brand_id`, `item.i_class_id`, and `item.i_category_id` are being selected without being aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause, hence the SQL error indicating that these columns must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function as specified by the error message.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the second SELECT statement within the main grouping query, right"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

In the `date_dim` table, columns like `d_date_sk`, `d_year`, `d_week_seq`, and `d_moy` are correctly referenced.

The columns referenced within these tables, such as `i_item_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `cs_item_sk`, and `ws_item_sk`, also exist. In the `date_dim` table, columns like `d_date_sk`, `d_year`, `d_week_seq`, and `d_moy` are correctly referenced. However, there are specific columns in the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables that seem to be used (like `ss_quantity`, `cs_quantity`, and `ws_quantity`) without their context being defined in the schema provided. There is no description for these columns in the schema, suggesting that they might not exist or have been missed.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error indicated is a syntax error at the end of the input, which is likely due to an incomplete SQL statement.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

In this case, it appears that the final section of the query, likely intended to aggregate the second subquery for 'store', is truncated or missing a closing operation such as a closing parenthesis or is not fully formed. The error may arise from the incomplete portion after the `HAVING` clause where there are no further operations to complete the SQL statement"

In this case, it appears that the final section of the query, likely intended to aggregate the second subquery for 'store', is truncated or missing a closing operation such as a closing parenthesis or is not fully formed.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.
