This indicates that the subquery which is supposed to provide data to the main query is likely missing a closing parenthesis or a `FROM` clause after the aggregation functions. The mention of the relevant column references that do not line up with a potential FROM clause or outer query can also lead to such confusion.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the definition of the numeric columns (`sum(ss_coupon_amt) amt` and `sum(ss_net_profit) profit`).

However, there are no specific details about the actual schema information given in the prompt to verify the existence of these tables. Assuming these tables are part of the schema, the columns being referenced within these tables such as `ss_sold_date_sk`, `d_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, etc., should also exist. If any one of these referenced tables or columns does not exist in the schema, that would lead to an error.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error message indicates a syntax error at the end of the input, which suggests that the query is incomplete or improperly structured. After the filtering condition involving `household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 9 or`, there is an abrupt interruption. It appears that the query is missing additional criteria or a closing part, which is why the SQL parser is generating a syntax error. The incomplete logical condition leads to confusion, as the SQL statement does not properly conclude.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located directly after the condition involving `household_demographics"
