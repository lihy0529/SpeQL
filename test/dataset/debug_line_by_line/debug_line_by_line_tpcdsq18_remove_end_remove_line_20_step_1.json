Additionally, the error message indicates a syntax issue at the end of the input, suggesting that the query lacks a closing structure or valid termination, such as a missing parenthesis or additional clauses to finalize it.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located towards the end of the query right after a series of UNION ALL statements.

The only tables that exist in the schema are item and customer_demographics, but those are insufficient to support the query as written, which likely leads to errors due to missing definitions.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The errors in the query stem from referring to non-existent tables (catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim) and potentially incorrect field names related to those tables that are not defined in the given schema. Additionally, the error message indicates a syntax issue at the end of the input, suggesting that the query lacks a closing structure or valid termination, such as a missing parenthesis or additional clauses to finalize it.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located towards the end of the query right after a series of UNION ALL statements.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

However, the column `c_current_cdemo_sk` from the `customer` table is not defined in the provided schema. Additionally, while `ca_country`, `ca_state`, and `ca_county` are referenced, they are not listed in the schema for the `customer_address` table, which raises questions about their existence in that specific table context. The columns from `customer_demographics` exist, but the use of `c_birth_month` and `c_birth_year` may also raise concerns due to their absence in the provided schema information.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The errors arise from several missing references. Specifically, there is a problem with the use of `c_current_cdemo_sk` which does not exist in the schema. Also, the absence of `ca_country`, `ca_state`, and `ca_county` in the schema, assuming they should originate from `customer_address`, indicates that these columns may not be correctly referenced.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

The 'customer_demographics' table is correctly referenced, and its columns 'cd_dep_count' and 'cd_gender' exist, but 'c_birth_year' is referenced without validation from the schema, as there is no corresponding column in 'customer_demographics'. The 'date_dim' table is also used, but it is not defined in the provided schema. Lastly, the 'item' table is mentioned, and it does exist in the schema.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The main issues here stem from referencing tables ('catalog_sales', 'customer', 'customer_address', and 'date_dim') that do not exist in the schema.
