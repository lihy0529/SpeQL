This suggests that the subquery from which the main query is attempting to select is incomplete or improperly terminated. Specifically, there seems to be an issue with the ending of the subquery that starts with `from (select ...`, which is not fully closed with a corresponding `)`. This incomplete syntax results in the parser not understanding the intended structure of the SQL query.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located in the query immediately after the reference to `store.s_city` and before the commented out error message."

However, the column `ss_ticket_number` from the `store_sales` table must be included in the GROUP BY clause or used in an aggregate function, which it currently isn't. The columns `ss_coupon_amt` and `ss_net_profit` are also used correctly in the aggregates, as they are summed.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error arises because the column `store_sales.ss_ticket_number` is being selected without being included in either the GROUP BY clause or without being wrapped in an aggregate function. This results in an SQL execution error, indicating that the referenced column must be either grouped or aggregated.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located after the line where the conditions are specified in the WHERE clause and before the closing parentheses of the subquery. In the corrected query, this marker should remain in the exact same position, preserving its alignment within the overall structure of the query."
