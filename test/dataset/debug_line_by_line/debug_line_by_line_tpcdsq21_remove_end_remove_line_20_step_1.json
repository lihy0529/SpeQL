The inner query appears to be attempting to return columns, but it is not fully constructed as the outer query lacks a corresponding statement to finalize its execution. This can lead to confusion in parsing, particularly if it expects a correct closing format.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the second 'then inv_quantity_on_hand' line, before the final part of the SQL query completes.

While we have no schema information here to validate these directly, the error message indicates that `w_warehouse_name` does not exist. The other columns mentioned need to be confirmed against the schema, but since `w_warehouse_name` is explicitly flagged as missing, that is a critical issue regardless of the status of the other columns.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error stems from an invalid reference to the column `w_warehouse_name`, which does not exist in the current context of the query. This could be due to a typo in the column name, an incorrect table that should have been referenced, or perhaps the column is simply not part of the schema in use. This results in an inability to execute the query correctly as it stands.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the last column summary and before any potential outer query structure begins.

Without the complete schema for all involved tables, it's hard to ascertain the validity of these column names.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error arises due to the unfinished `WHERE` clause which is positioned just before the `/*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/`. There seems to be an incomplete join or condition clause, possibly because no logical condition was completed, such as connecting `warehouse`, `item`, or `date_dim` with the `inventory` table.

However, the query also references three other tables: 'warehouse', 'item', and 'date_dim'. There are no column names specified in the schema for these tables, which raises questions about their existence and the specific columns being used in the query. For instance, 'i_current_price' and 'i_item_sk' from the 'item' table are not validated against the schema since no schema information is provided for this table.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic): The query has a syntax error because it lacks a closing parenthesis for the first subquery before the final 'from' statement in the outer query. Additionally, there might be missing information about the columns used from the 'warehouse' and 'item' tables, as these are not validated in the provided schema. This contributes to potential ambiguity, which can cause issues when executing the query.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just after the 'and inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk' condition in the where clause.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
