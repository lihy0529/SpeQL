Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

However, the schema information provided does not include the `store_sales` table, making it a missing reference. The other tables (`household_demographics`, `time_dim`, and `store`) and their specified columns are present in the schema. For example, `household_demographics.hd_demo_sk`, `time_dim.t_time_sk`, and `store.s_store_sk` all exist in the schema, but any column from the `store_sales` table cannot be validated since that table is not listed.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The primary error is that the `store_sales` table is referenced throughout the query, but it does not exist in the provided schema. Additionally, there is a syntax error near the end of the query, specifically the abrupt ending without closing parentheses for the last subquery block. Thus, after referencing the `store_sales` table, the query lacks valid closure, leading to the error message indicating a syntax issue at the end of input.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just before the final subquery section which attempts to count",

Additionally, there is a syntax error near the end of the query, specifically the abrupt ending without closing parentheses for the last subquery block. Thus, after referencing the `store_sales` table, the query lacks valid closure, leading to the error message indicating a syntax issue at the end of input.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just before the final subquery section which attempts to count"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

However, the `ss_store_sk` column, which is joined with `s_store_sk`, does not have a corresponding valid reference in the provided schema for the `store_sales` table or the `time_dim` table since their structure isn't listed. This implies that there may be missing column definitions or typographical errors.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The primary error in this SQL query seems to be related to the missing or invalid reference for `(ss_store_sk = s_store_sk)` since `ss_store_sk` is not defined in the schema provided.

The remaining tables, `household_demographics`, `time_dim`, and `store`, have valid columns listed in the schema. However, the `ss_store_sk` column, which is joined with `s_store_sk`, does not have a corresponding valid reference in the provided schema for the `store_sales` table or the `time_dim` table since their structure isn't listed. This implies that there may be missing column definitions or typographical errors.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The primary error in this SQL query seems to be related to the missing or invalid reference for `(ss_store_sk = s_store_sk)` since `ss_store_sk` is not defined in the schema provided. Additionally, the query has an incomplete syntax indicated by the error message `syntax error at end of input`. This likely results from not properly closing the final subquery.

The schema indicates that `household_demographics` has the columns `HD_DEP_COUNT` and `HD_VEHICLE_COUNT`, which exist in the schema. However, the query refers to multiple columns (`ss_sold_time_sk`, `ss_hdemo_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `s_store_sk`, and `time_dim.t_time_sk`) from the `store_sales` and `time_dim` tables that are not listed in the schema provided. Specifically, `ss_sold_time_sk`, `ss_hdemo_sk`, and `ss_store_sk` are invalid references.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The errors primarily stem from the use of column names that do not exist in the specified schemas, specifically the columns from the `store_sales` table. Additionally, the query ends prematurely at `h12_to_12_30`, resulting in a syntax error due to an incomplete structure. This indicates that the query might be missing critical components such as a closing parentheses or a final select statement defining what outputs are expected.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located at the end",

Additionally, the query ends prematurely at `h12_to_12_30`, resulting in a syntax error due to an incomplete structure. This indicates that the query might be missing critical components such as a closing parentheses or a final select statement defining what outputs are expected.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located at the end"

The `store` table is referenced correctly with columns such as `s_store_sk` and `s_store_name`. The `household_demographics` table is also referenced correctly with columns such as `hd_demo_sk`, `hd_dep_count`, and `hd_vehicle_count`. However, there is an apparent reference to the `store_sales` and `time_dim` tables, but their schema details are not provided. This is crucial for validating columns like `ss_sold_time_sk`, `t_time_sk`, `t_hour`, and `t_minute`. These specific columns must exist within their respective tables for the query to be correct, but without their schema, it's uncertain.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The main issue in the query is a syntax error due to an incomplete statement. Each subquery successfully ends with a parenthesis and an alias, except for the last. The syntax error may be caused by the missing or misplaced closing parenthesis or lack of completion of the final subquery statement. The correct ending for the subquery structure is crucial for SQL execution, as indicated by the error message pointing to an unexpected state",

You only explain what is wrong based on the schema and the query itself.\nIdentify whether all referenced tables and columns exist in the schema.\nExplain the error clearly and briefly, without altering the query's semantics or adding new logic.\nIdentify exactly where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located and confirm that it must remain in the same position in the corrected query.\nKeep the case sensitivity, formatting, and spacing as in the original query.\nIf the dialect is Redshift and date arithmetic is involved, remember to use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\nYour answer should have three paragraphs, starting with: \"My explanation has the following three parts:\"\n\nFirst paragraph (start with \"Check schema:\"):\n\nState if each table/column is correct or if there are invalid references. Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query. Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

However, there is an apparent reference to the `store_sales` and `time_dim` tables, but their schema details are not provided. This is crucial for validating columns like `ss_sold_time_sk`, `t_time_sk`, `t_hour`, and `t_minute`. These specific columns must exist within their respective tables for the query to be correct, but without their schema, it's uncertain.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The main issue in the query is a syntax error due to an incomplete statement. Each subquery successfully ends with a parenthesis and an alias, except for the last. The syntax error may be caused by the missing or misplaced closing parenthesis or lack of completion of the final subquery statement. The correct ending for the subquery structure is crucial for SQL execution, as indicated by the error message pointing to an unexpected state"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Among these, `store_sales` and `time_dim` are referenced but not included in the provided schema information, therefore it cannot be confirmed whether they exist or not. The tables `household_demographics` and `store` are correct and exist. Additionally, all the columns referenced within these tables are either correct and exist in the given schema or are not specified adequately in the schema (like those from `store_sales` and `time_dim`).\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The query has two main issues. Firstly, it includes a syntax error at the end, as indicated by the message `'M': 'syntax error at end of input'`, suggesting that the query is incomplete or missing a closing section (like a closing parentheses or an additional select statement to complete the outer query). Secondly, the use of `<=0+2` and similar expressions is valid but potentially misleading; although such arithmetic is allowed, it may not reflect the intended logic clearly.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located at the end of the seventh subquery, right before the error",

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query. User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Specifically, the columns coming from these tables are undefined.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The query has a syntax error due to the incomplete final subquery. The final aggregation for `h12_to_12_30` is missing its closing parentheses and a corresponding AS clause to make it a complete subquery. This error is creating a syntax error at the end of the input as the parser expects a complete statement before the `/*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/`.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located directly after the incomplete subquery for `h12_to_12_30`.

However, `store_sales` and `time_dim` tables are not listed in the provided schema information, meaning they do not exist in the schema. This results in invalid references being made in the query. Specifically, the columns coming from these tables are undefined.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The query has a syntax error due to the incomplete final subquery. The final aggregation for `h12_to_12_30` is missing its closing parentheses and a corresponding AS clause to make it a complete subquery. This error is creating a syntax error at the end of the input as the parser expects a complete statement before the `/*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/`.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located directly after the incomplete subquery for `h12_to_12_30`. In the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure."
