Without schema information, we cannot definitively verify if any other referenced objects exist within the schema.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The query contains a syntax error. The original error message indicates that the parser encountered the end of input unexpectedly, implying that the query structure is incomplete. Typically, a common table expression (CTE) like `ssci` would be followed by a `select` query or another SQL statement that uses the CTE, but this is missing in the given input. Furthermore, as no additional column manipulations or operations follow the CTE, it results in an incomplete SQL command, causing the syntax error.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located directly after the comment about replacing the table name within the CTE, and before the JSON-style error message.

You need to confirm that both of these tables are present in the schema. The columns referenced in the SELECT statement are `ss_customer_sk` and `ss_item_sk`. You should verify if these columns exist in the `store_sales` table. If any of these references\u2014tables or columns\u2014are missing from the schema, it will lead to errors in the query.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error message indicates a syntax error at the end of the input. This typically suggests that there is an issue with how the SQL query is structured, such as a missing clause or improperly formed statement. In this case, there is likely a missing FROM clause or subsequent clause after the WITH statement, preventing the query from executing properly.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the FROM clause in the WITH expression. In the corrected query, it must remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure, ensuring that it continues to indicate where control might be passed within the SQL syntax in future query modifications or executions.",
