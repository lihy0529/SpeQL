Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

User knows what they are doing.\n\nYour output format should be:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 1\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"old\": \"original string 2\",\n        \"new\": \"replacement string 2\"\n    }\n]    \n```\n\nIf nothing needs to be changed, output:\n```json\n[]\n```\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
