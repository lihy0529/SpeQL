The schema specifies the existence of `store_sales` and `date_dim`, but it does not provide any information about the `store` table. Therefore, the reference to `store` in the `FROM` clause and any references to its columns, such as `s_store_sk` and `s_state`, would be invalid. The columns `ss_net_profit`, `ss_sold_date_sk`, and `s_store_sk` do exist in the specified tables, but we cannot confirm the existence of the `store` table or its columns.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The query lacks a defined structure for how the `store` table is related to the `store_sales` and `date_dim`. Specifically, the error arises from referencing the `store` table without proper context, leading to the inability of the SQL parser to resolve fields associated with `store`. Additionally, the mention of `gstate` and `g_county` without any calculations or references may also be a point of confusion, and the overall structure might imply an incomplete SQL statement, potentially leading to the syntax error at the end of"

Consequently, `s_store_sk`, `s_state`, and any other column reference from the `store` table will cause issues. \n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The main error arises from the referencing of the `store` table and its columns, which do not exist in the given schema. Additionally, the error message indicates a problem with the `total_sum` column in the final `SELECT` statement, which must be correctly defined in the scope of the query. Since `total_sum` is derived from the `results` common table expression, and that portion of the query refers to it correctly, it suggests that the issue primarily lies with the missing `store` table and its columns.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located at the end of the main query, just before the error message.

The `date_dim` table exists and it includes the column `d_month_seq` and `d_date_sk`, both of which are used correctly. However, the `store` table is referenced in the query, but there is no schema information provided for it, making it impossible to verify its existence or the columns being used. Additionally, the column `s_state` and `s_county` from the `store` table are referenced but their definitions and existence cannot be confirmed.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic): The error indicates that the column `total_sum` does not exist in the final select statement. This is likely because `total_sum` is defined in the Common Table Expression (CTE) `results`, but the final query seems to be missing a reference to `total_sum` that should be carried over from the CTE due to probable scope-related issues or it may involve a misunderstanding of the context in which `total_sum` is being referenced. Additionally, without confirmed existence and definitions for the `store` table, it's unclear if any columns referenced from it are valid."
