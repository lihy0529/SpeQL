Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Unfortunately, the schema details have not been provided, so I cannot confirm whether the tables `item`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim` or their columns like `i_brand_id`, `i_brand`, `ws_ext_sales_price`, etc., actually exist. However, the query is likely assuming that all these necessary tables and columns are present and correctly named in the schema. If any of these elements don't exist or are misnamed in the database, that would directly cause errors in executing the query.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error specifically relates to the use of the EXTRACT function, which attempts to get parts of a date/time value from a numeric column `time_sk`. If `time_sk` isn't of a date/time data type, it would result in a type mismatch. Since the query involves `time_sk`, which seems intended to be a reference to a datetime field, it might not be correct, hence causing a function resolution error as stated in the error message \"function pg_catalog.date_part(\"unknown\", integer) does"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

However, the error points towards an issue with the date arithmetic or the processing of the `d_moy` and `d_year` columns, suggesting a problem with how the function handling these values is being used. It is crucial to ensure that the appropriate function for date extraction is referenced correctly per Redshift requirements.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `date_part` function, specifically that the arguments provided do not match any available functions. This is often related to incorrect datatype handling or assumptions about function overloads in Redshift. In this case, there could be a misinterpretation of how to utilize date parts or extracts in the environment being used.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
