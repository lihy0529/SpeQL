The tables \"date_dim\", \"store\", \"household_demographics\", and \"customer_address\" are mentioned in the query but do not have any schema information provided, so it cannot be confirmed if those tables and their columns exist or not; thus, it leads to potential errors regarding those references.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The query contains multiple references to columns that do not exist based on the schema provided. Specifically, \"ss_customer_sk\" cannot be verified as existing in the schema, and all aliases such as \"bought_city\" with \"ca_city\" lack context since the required tables are not listed in the schema. Additionally, the SQL statement ends abruptly after the WHERE clause without a completion, leading to a syntax error.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located right after the WHERE clause within the subquery.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it. Do not modify the parameters of the query.

Therefore, `date_dim`, `store`, `household_demographics`, and `customer_address` are not correctly referenced according to the schema.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The errors stem from references to tables and columns that do not exist in the schema.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

We have the schema information for the `store_sales` table, but not for the others (`date_dim`, `store`, `household_demographics`, `customer_address`, and `customer`). Therefore, while we can confirm that the column `ss_ticket_number` exists in the `store_sales` table, we don't have confirmation about the existence of columns `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `ca_city`, `ss_customer_sk`, `ss_ext_sales_price`, `ss_ext_list_price`, and `ss_ext_tax` in the other tables involved because their schemas aren't provided.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error indicates an invalid reference to the table `customer_address` in specifying `customer_address.ca_city bought_city` in the outer select clause. The reference is invalid because `customer_address` is no longer available in the outer scope as it is not part of the `dn` derived table. Further, in the subquery, once aggregated data is prepared, columns used within the aggregation functions cannot be directly referenced without being part"
