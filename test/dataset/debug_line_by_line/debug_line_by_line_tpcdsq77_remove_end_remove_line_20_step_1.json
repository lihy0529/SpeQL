However, `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `catalog_sales`, `catalog_returns`, `web_sales`, and `web_returns` do not exist in the schema information given, which means these references are invalid. The only valid table consistently referenced is `date_dim`, which is correctly referenced with columns such as `d_date_sk` and `d_date`.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error is mainly due to the fact that several tables (such as `store_sales`, `store_returns`, etc.) are referenced in the query but do not exist in the provided schema. This results in a syntax error as the query cannot locate these tables. Furthermore, when attempting to access columns like `ss_sold_date_sk`, `sr_return_amt`, and others, the database cannot resolve these names due to the absence of their parent tables, leading to the noted syntax error occurring near the nested `select` statement.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just after the last UNION ALL statement",

However, `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `catalog_sales`, `catalog_returns`, `web_sales`, and `web_returns` do not exist in the schema information given, which means these references are invalid. The only valid table consistently referenced is `date_dim`, which is correctly referenced with columns such as `d_date_sk` and `d_date`.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error is mainly due to the fact that several tables (such as `store_sales`, `store_returns`, etc.) are referenced in the query but do not exist in the provided schema. This results in a syntax error as the query cannot locate these tables. Furthermore, when attempting to access columns like `ss_sold_date_sk`, `sr_return_amt`, and others, the database cannot resolve these names due to the absence of their parent tables, leading to the noted syntax error occurring near the nested `select` statement.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just after the last UNION ALL statement"

The columns like `ss_ext_sales_price`, `sr_return_amt`, `cs_ext_sales_price`, `cr_return_amount`, `ws_ext_sales_price`, `wr_return_amt`, are likely derived from these tables, following typical naming conventions relative to their operations such as sales and returns, but are not explicitly verified against the provided schema since those specific columns are not listed.

However, `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `catalog_sales`, `catalog_returns`, `web_sales`, and `web_returns` do not exist in the schema information given, which means these references are invalid. The only valid table consistently referenced is `date_dim`, which is correctly referenced with columns such as `d_date_sk` and `d_date`.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The error is mainly due to the fact that several tables (such as `store_sales`, `store_returns`, etc.) are referenced in the query but do not exist in the provided schema. This results in a syntax error as the query cannot locate these tables. Furthermore, when attempting to access columns like `ss_sold_date_sk`, `sr_return_amt`, and others, the database cannot resolve these names due to the absence of their parent tables, leading to the noted syntax error occurring near the nested `select` statement.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located just after the last UNION ALL statement"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

In the `store_sales` table, the column `ss_ext_sales_price` exists. However, the column `ss_sold_date_sk` is not explicitly mentioned in the schema, which raises a concern about its validity. The same issue arises with `sr_return_amt` and `sr_returned_date_sk` in the `store_returns` table, as these columns are also not listed in the schema. For the `catalog_sales` table, `cs_ext_sales_price`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, and `cs_call_center_sk` are not defined in the schema. Similarly, for `catalog_returns`, `cr_return_amount` and `cr_returned_date_sk` are not found in the schema. In the `web_sales` and `web_returns` tables, `ws_ext_sales_price`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `wp_web_page_sk`, `wr_return_amt`, `wr_returned_date_sk`, and `wr_net_loss` also lack references in the schema definitions.

In the `store_sales` table, the column `ss_ext_sales_price` exists. However, the column `ss_sold_date_sk` is not explicitly mentioned in the schema, which raises a concern about its validity. The same issue arises with `sr_return_amt` and `sr_returned_date_sk` in the `store_returns` table, as these columns are also not listed in the schema. For the `catalog_sales` table, `cs_ext_sales_price`, `cs_sold_date_sk`, and `cs_call_center_sk` are not defined in the schema. Similarly, for `catalog_returns`, `cr_return_amount` and `cr_returned_date_sk` are not found in the schema. In the `web_sales` and `web_returns` tables, `ws_ext_sales_price`, `ws_sold_date_sk`, `wp_web_page_sk`, `wr_return_amt`, `wr_returned_date_sk`, and `wr_net_loss` also lack references in the schema definitions. Thus, several column references in the query are potentially invalid.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The syntax error reported indicates a problem"

Be explicit about what exists in the schema and what doesn't.\nSecond paragraph (start with \"Explain error (without changing any semantic...):\"):\n\nBriefly describe the nature of the errors (typos, incorrect table/column names, syntax errors).\nDo not rewrite the entire query. Only point out the errors.\nThird paragraph (start with \"Identify cursor position:\"):\n\nClearly state where the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is in the original query.\nIndicate that in the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position relative to the query structure.    \n"

Similarly, `sr_return_amt` and `sr_net_loss` are not defined in the `store_returns` table.

Furthermore, `cr_return_amount` and `cr_net_loss` do not exist in the `catalog_returns` table. The `web_sales` table must contain `ws_ext_sales_price` and `ws_net_profit`, both of which are undefined in the schema. Finally, the columns `wr_return_amt` and `wr_net_loss` also do not exist in the `web_returns` table. \n\nExplain error (without changing any semantics): The syntax error as indicated by the error message seems to occur because of the presence of the `select` statement after the `/*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/`.

Consequently, the columns such as `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_ext_sales_price`, `sr_return_amt`, `sr_returned_date_sk`, `cs_call_center_sk`, `cs_ext_sales_price`, `cr_call_center_sk`, and `cr_return_amount` also do not exist.

These invalid references are primarily in the use of tables such as `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `catalog_sales`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_sales`, as well as several field identifiers that relate to these tables.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

might be: middle: WHERE \"column\" > 0 AND \"column\" IS NOT NULL\n"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
