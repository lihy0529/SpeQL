Therefore, this is an invalid reference. No specific tables were mentioned in the query, so we cannot validate against any table names, but the column itself seems to be the central issue if it is supposed to exist in any table. \n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error message indicates a problem with the column name. Specifically, the query is attempting to select a column \"i_item_id\" that the database does not recognize as existing, leading to the reported error code '42703'. This suggests that the column name might either be misspelled or entirely absent from the schema.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ is located immediately after the \"i_item_id\" in the select statement. In the corrected query, it should remain in the exact same position, which is critical for the functionality of any subsequent processing or execution of the query."

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
