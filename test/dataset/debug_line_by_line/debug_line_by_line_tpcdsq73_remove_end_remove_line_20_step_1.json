Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.

Without explicit schema details, it's assumed these tables and columns exist, as there are no clear typographical errors in their naming.\n\nExplain error (without changing any semantic...): The error message indicates a \"syntax error at end of input\", which typically suggests that the query is incomplete or an expected element (such as a final closing parenthesis or additional clause) is missing. In this query, the `group by` clause is not followed by where the query might expect additional structure or closure of the subquery, but it ends abruptly, likely causing the error.\n\nIdentify cursor position: The `/*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/` comment is located right after the `group by ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk` line. This cursor comment serves as a marker and in any corrected query, it should remain exactly"

Only fix clear typos or non-existent references.\n- If you need to add or remove something, make sure the 'old' part is unique enough and that the 'new' part includes the /*CURSOR_IDENTIFIER*/ if it was there originally.\n- If you need to select top rows, remember \"SELECT top #number\" is equivalent to using \"LIMIT\" and should not be considered an error.\n- If there's a need for date operations and the dialect is Redshift, use DATEADD instead of INTERVAL.\n- If the query can run as is, do not change it.
