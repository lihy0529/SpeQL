   - Click the `Install` button next to the SpeQL extension.
   - After installation, the `SpeQL` icon will appear in the VSCode toolbar.

6. **Run Your First Query**:
   - Type the following query in the SQL editor:
     ```sql
     SELECT 1 AS one;
     ```
   - The running query and its result will appear in the preview panel.
   - As you edit your SQL queries, the results will update automatically. Differences between the editor and the preview are highlighted in the Diff window.
   - Now you have successfully installed and opened SpeQL. Great job!

7. **Details**:
   - Basically, you can trigger SpeQL in two ways:
   - **Automatic Trigger**:
      - SpeQL fetches the latest SQL editor input every 5 seconds.
   - **Manual Trigger**:
      - Press double `Enter` in the SQL editor to manually trigger SpeQL.
      - Upon triggering, a rotating icon will appear in the toolbar, changing to a checkmark once the result is ready.
   - **Note**:
     - SpeQL will prioritize the query at the cursor position. If your cursor is in a subquery, SpeQL will preview the subquery result.
     - It is recommended to keep only one SQL query in the editor. If there are multiple SQL queries in the editor, ensure they are separated by semicolons.

#### Advanced Features
*There are some advanced features to explore!*
